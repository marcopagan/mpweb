    <p>Il Deserto dei Tartari is a novel written by Dino Buzzati. The plot of the novel is Drogo’s lifelong wait for a great war in which his life as a soldier and the existence of the fort can prove its usefulness. The human need for giving life a meaning and the soldier’s desire for glory are themes in the novel.</p>
    <p>To create a visual parallel narration to the novel, we used Gaetano Kanitzsa’s illustrations. Extrapolated from his gestalt psychology’s books, they get a new meaning, amplificating the most illusory and reflective moments in Drogo’s life. In the same way Drogo tries to find a meaning in his meaningless wait, the reader is led to search for meaning in the ambiguos images.</p>
    <p>We also used typography in an expressive way. We created two variations of Messina Serif, inspired by Kanitzsa’s illustrations, for Drogo’s pensive moments. A sans font is used for the more disillusioned moments.</p>
